To configure port redirection from port 8080/TCP to port 80/TCP on the web-01 server using ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall), follow these steps:

Step 1: Enable IP Forwarding
First, ensure that IP forwarding is enabled on the server, as this is necessary for NAT (Network Address Translation) rules to work:

Edit the sysctl.conf file:

bash
Copy code
nano /etc/sysctl.conf
Add or uncomment the following line:

Copy code
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
Apply the changes:

bash
Copy code
sysctl -p
Step 2: Configure UFW to Allow Forwarding
UFW by default does not allow forwarding. To enable it, modify the UFW configuration:

Edit the ufw configuration file:

bash
Copy code
nano /etc/default/ufw
Change the DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY to "ACCEPT":

makefile
Copy code
DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="ACCEPT"
Step 3: Add NAT Rule for Port Redirection
Add a NAT rule to redirect incoming traffic on port 8080 to port 80. This involves editing the UFW before rules file:

Edit the before.rules file:

bash
Copy code
nano /etc/ufw/before.rules
Add the following rules at the beginning of the file, before the *filter section:

less
Copy code
*nat
:PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
-A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80
COMMIT
Save and close the file.

Step 4: Enable the Firewall and Rules
After configuring UFW and the necessary rules, enable and reload UFW to apply the changes:

bash
Copy code
ufw enable
ufw reload
Final UFW Configuration Output
To check that your configurations are correct and the rule has been implemented, you can list the active rules:

bash
Copy code
ufw status verbose
Additionally, ensure that the configuration files are saved properly. Here is how your relevant configuration file, specifically the before.rules, should look for the port redirection:

plaintext
Copy code
# /etc/ufw/before.rules
*nat
:PREROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
-A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80
COMMIT

# Don't delete these required lines, otherwise there will be errors
*filter
...
(rest of the rules)
...
Make sure to test the configuration by attempting to access your web server on port 8080 from another machine (as seen in your curl test from web-02) to ensure that the redirection works correctly.
