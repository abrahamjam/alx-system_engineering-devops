Task: 0x19. Postmortem

Topic: My First Postmortem


Issue Summary:

Duration: May 10, 2024, 12:00 PM - May 10, 2024, 3:30 PM (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced a complete outage, affecting 75% of users. Users reported inability to access the service and encountered error messages.
Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a database failure due to a sudden spike in concurrent connections, overwhelming the database server.

Timeline:

12:00 PM: The issue was first detected when monitoring alerts indicated a sharp increase in error rates.
12:15 PM: Engineers began investigating potential causes, initially suspecting network issues or a misconfiguration.
1:00 PM: Misleading paths were pursued, including examining recent code deployments and server logs, leading to no conclusive findings.
2:00 PM: With the assistance of the database team, it was discovered that the database server was unable to handle the influx of concurrent connections.
2:30 PM: The incident was escalated to senior engineers and management for further assistance and resource allocation.
3:00 PM: To alleviate the issue, engineers implemented database connection pooling and optimized query execution.
3:30 PM: The web application was restored to full functionality, and error rates returned to normal levels.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Cause: A sudden surge in concurrent connections overwhelmed the database server, causing it to become unresponsive.
Resolution: Database connection pooling was implemented to manage and optimize the handling of connections. Additionally, query optimization techniques were applied to improve database performance.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated scaling for database resources to handle sudden spikes in traffic.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect abnormal patterns in database usage.
Conduct regular load testing to ensure the system can withstand high levels of concurrent connections.
Tasks:
Configure database connection pooling across all environments.
Set up automated alerts for abnormal database activity.
Conduct a post-mortem meeting to analyze the incident and identify further improvements.
In conclusion, the outage was caused by a database failure resulting from excessive concurrent connections. Through collaborative investigation and implementation of database optimizations, the issue was promptly resolved. Moving forward, proactive measures will be taken to enhance system resilience and mitigate the risk of similar incidents.
